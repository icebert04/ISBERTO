# We are next in line...

# Why I need to maintain the Isberto.org 

I created this website as part of my school project 2 years ago. At that time, my goal is to get somebody who will fund for it then deploy the site live.
So I went to my Papa Noel and his brothers to help me with it.

# Now what??

> After making the site, I really don't know what to do. 
>
> I feel all alone. Adding a Facebook group just did a little help on the project.
>
> The domain name is about to expire... should I renew it?
>
> Is this the end of the line of the Isberto.org/

# Then my Dad told me this...

```js
// He told me that I should think about the next generation. 
That we are next in line and { 
  it's our responsibility to continue our family name 
  that once started in the small province of Kalibo Aklan;
}

// So I look into my Facebook and made this list of the newest generation...

Here is the list...

```ruby
# I noticed that we are about 8 newbies who will someday have children in the future

That is when I saw that each one of us including the older generations should contribute
by adding pictures, videos, and stories and store it all in this site.
  
That is when I saw the importance of the Isberto.org
It is not a project anymore, but more of a Family Tree diary that will 
carry on from my generation to the next
